# ✨ Welcome to my profile! ✨

I am **Nathan Guerrero**, a software developer and tinkerer, with a focus on DevOps and the back-end. At the moment, *I am looking for work*!

Starting from childhood, creating and tinkering with software has been a passion of mine: one that has followed me into college and beyond. Throughout my journey, with my persistence and my attention to detail, I have gained a broad range of experience, including in team hackathons and numerous group projects.

I am strongly proficient in Python, C/C++, and Java, with experience across the entire stack, from React to SQL. More importantly than any technology, I have the ability to quickly learn new skills and languages, as well as break down any complex problem into concise and idiomatic solutions.

In my free time, I like to game and compose/produce music. Additionally, I have an intermediate fluency in both Spanish and Japanese.

Currently based in San Diego, CA, having graduated from the University of California, Irvine in 2025, with a B.S. in Computer Science.

Much of my time is spent homelabbing and self-hosting, which is shown in the Sapphic Homelab/Home Server, a cluster of repurposed machines and equipment, which is the center of numerous services and even more hours of experimentation. These machines run Proxmox and TrueNAS SCALE, which host a plethora of NixOS/Linux-based virtual machines and Docker-based containers (with Docker Compose and Komodo); these services and VMs are further supported with CI/CD pipelines and custom scripts for automating common tasks, such as building and backup. Examples of such services are Home Assistant, Pterodactyl, and the Garage S3 server. If you want a video demonstration, [you can watch it here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI5Pl6_dHzY)

Here's a list of repos and resources maintained for the Sapphic Homelab:
