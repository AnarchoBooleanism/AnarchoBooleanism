# ✨ Welcome to my profile! ✨

I am **Nathan Guerrero**, a tinkerer and software developer, with a focus on DevOps and the back-end. At the moment, *I am looking for work*! (Remote or in-office will do)

I am strongly proficient in Python, C/C++, and Java, with experience across the entire stack, from React to SQL. As for DevOps, I am knowledgeable in Docker, Nix & Ansible (for IaC), shell scripting (e.g. Bash), and CI/CD pipelines (with GitHub Actions).

Currently based in *San Diego, CA*, having graduated from the University of California, Irvine in 2025, with a B.S. in Computer Science.

Much of my time is spent homelabbing/self-hosting, shown in the **Sapphic Homelab/Home Server**, a cluster of repurposed machines running Proxmox and TrueNAS SCALE. They host many NixOS/Linux-based virtual machines and Docker-based containers (with Docker Compose and Komodo), supported with CI/CD pipelines and automation scripts. Services hosted include *Home Assistant*, *Pterodactyl* (a game host), and *a Linux-based development server*, all connected together with Traefik and Tailscale. [Here is a video demonstration.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI5Pl6_dHzY)

As well, I daily drive Arch Linux, with my dotfiles and other configuration in [linux-config](https://github.com/AnarchoBooleanism/linux-config)!
